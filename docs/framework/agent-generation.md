# Agent Generation

Location: core/framework/agent_generation/

Agent-generation is a planned feature that will introduce an AI agent capable
of analyzing a repository and producing structured outputs for maintainers.

Planned future capabilities:
- Repository analysis and summarization.
- Plan generation with phased steps.
- Proposed diffs and PR-ready artifacts.

Explicitly not implemented yet:
- No execution or code changes.
- No automated planning or diff creation.
- No integration with CLI, APIs, or runtimes.

This scaffold defines the boundary for future agent contracts.
