## Part 4: Creative Challenge (10 points)

### Task 4.1: Agent Idea 💡
Aden can build self-improving agents for any use case. Propose ONE creative agent idea:

1. **Name:** Give your agent a catchy name. 
2. **Goal:** What problem does it solve? (2-3 sentences)
3. **Self-Improvement:** How would it get better over time when things fail?
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** When would it need human input?

Example format:
```
Name: DocBot
Goal: Automatically keeps documentation in sync with code changes.
      Monitors PRs and updates relevant docs.
Self-Improvement: When docs get rejected in review, it learns the feedback
                  and adjusts its writing style and coverage.
Human-in-the-Loop: Major architectural changes require human approval
                   before doc updates go live.
```
