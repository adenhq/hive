# Agent Generation (Scaffold)

This module is a placeholder for the future "agent-generation" feature.
It will host the agent responsible for analyzing repositories and producing
plans, diffs, and PR-ready outputs.

Current status:
- No runtime behavior.
- No wiring into CLI or services.
- Placeholders only.
