## 🎯 WHAT IT DOES

### The Complete Self-Improvement Loop:

```
1. MONITOR
   └─> Evaluator tracks performance (accuracy, cost, latency)

2. DETECT  
   └─> Identifies when agent degrades below threshold

3. ANALYZE
   └─> Failure Analyzer categorizes errors and finds patterns

4. DECIDE
   └─> Improvement Trigger determines priority and actions

5. REPAIR
   └─> Self-Repair Engine generates and applies fixes

6. VERIFY
   └─> Re-evaluates to confirm improvement

7. REPEAT
   └─> Continuous monitoring ensures ongoing quality
```
